//     So, since I don't know how to write in Markdown, I can certainly comment with the best of them.

//     Thank you for this. I am now a server, and I have a project in Node.js Express.

//     My adventure continues now that I've updated to express - all of this, mind you, was stuff I didn't know how to do (well, most - I did know how to open the terminal window :) )

//      I have found a couple of additional items that I don't know how to incorporate into what you've shown me.  Can I get your thoughts on these?

//      https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/examples/nodejs-sample

//      That directs me, after some basic setup langauge, to this page: https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings/tree/master/nodejs
//         What strikes me about this page is the link to the "ProtBuf.js" library - which I think is likely an important library for reading the .proto files that are part of parsing this feed:

//Also, I've found this and, like many other things, I think it's important despite having no sense of how to use it:
